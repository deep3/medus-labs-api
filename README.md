# Medus Labs API

Medus Labs is a tool for automating the management of multiple AWS accounts that you need to configure identically and remove all assets when finished with.

This application was developed for teaching or lab usage and can quickly setup a number of accounts for students to use for a class and then easily remove and clean up the environments after.
